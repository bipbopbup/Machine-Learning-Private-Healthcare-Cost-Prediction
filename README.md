# Machine-Learning-Private-Healthcare-Cost-Prediction

By @bipbopbup and @

A Colab Notebook with an extensive analysis and data preprocessing used to implement a ML Model which predicts healthcare costs. Through an extensive preprocessing research we have achieved great results with a very simple model, i.e., Lasso.

The notebook has been separated into the following parts:
- Libraries and Dataset Load
- Initial Study
- Preprocessing
- Lasso regularization
- Analysis results
- Validation
- Predictions
- Saving Generated Predictions
